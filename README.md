###Spec
When you write code in block,'self' is captured by the plugin.Plugin alerts view show it might caught retain circle.Outside the Block '__block'
is captured,if it attributes an object,it alerts view show it would not remove retain circle, it would tell you whether use __weak instead.

To save power,a time interval is exist,and it just simply mentions you, not by critical lexical analysis.
